      Yoooo <br><br>
      ¡Feliz Cumpleaños!  Kinda sucks that we only started to get to know each other towards the end of the on-campus semester, but it has nonetheless been a blast to get to know you virtually.  You’re an amazing friend and I really appreciate those endless conversations we’ve had about god knows what at 2am.  I love your sense of humor and your positive vibes are contagious as hell. Can’t wait to be back on campus drunk and having you carry me around campus at 1am.  Cabot doesn’t know what it’s in for, honestly.<br><br>

      Best wishes,<br>

      Andres
