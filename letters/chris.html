      Happy Birthday Steph!<br>

I know things weren't the best between us at the end of the term, but since before Fall term on FOP you've been one of the kindest people I've met at Harvard, and after hearing your story, one of the strongest. You've been and still are a great friend. I hope Zoom and this term wasn't too bad and that you'll still have a great birthday. <br>

Much love and all the best,<br>
Chris
