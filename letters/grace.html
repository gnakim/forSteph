      STEPHANY! <br>
I love you so very much and I’m so glad to have a whole day to celebrate YOU in all of your silliness, intelligence, compassion, beauty and heart. The universe really knew what she was doing when she sat us next to each other in 5th grade humanities :,,) and Im so grateful to have you as one of my best friends. It’s been incredible to witness you grow up into the confident and ambitious young woman you are today and the community of friends you’ve made at Harvard is a true testament to your character and your ability to be a caring friend. You need to thank them for organizing this!! :)) thanks for keeping me around in your ever-expanding circle of peers and friends and loved ones. i can’t wait to celebrate with you in. I’m sending sooooo much love and hugs and kisses your way. ❤️

Love, Grace
