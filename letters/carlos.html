    <h1>Not Carlos (Lorem ipsum) </h1>
    <p>
      You are only one in my mind and in my heart. Do you know the effect you have on me? Even in times of stress, I find myself calmer than usual. I always seem to find the lighter side in things and situations. This is so unlike me, the pessimist I used to be. You are the only angel in my heart of heaven.<br>
I want to let you know that love is something eternal; the aspect may change but not the essence. Love asks me no questions and gives me endless support. Through love I want to express whole feelings of my heart for you, I love you so much.<br>
The love you have given me is so special, my whole day is filled with thoughts of you, falling in love with you is the best thing that ever happened in my life.
<br>There are thousands of yesterday and there are billions of tomorrows but there is only one today and I will not let the day go by without showcasing my love for you, telling you how I feel about you each day, I love you every day of my life.<br>
I donâ€™t need the sun because you are the sun in my life, your shine brightens up my life, I am very sure of loving you forever.
<br> C, your man
