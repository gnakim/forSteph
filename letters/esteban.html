    <h1>Esteban Gutierrez </h1>
    <p>
      Happy birthday Steph!<br><br>

Here's the thing: even with the two in-person interactions we had as a blocking group, I know we're going to have such a hype time when we're actually back on campus in the next few months. You're the person that people want to be around to have fun; even though you make some mistakes sometimes, you know what people want and how to get people that fun no matter the cost. Everyone at the end of the night ends up having a blast, and you're part of the reason why that happens. I'm expecting some wild nights once we get the chance to party in the fall or spring. <br>

Even them, you're someone so resilient and incredible that we can all look at for inspiration. You love what you do and will do whatever it takes to get to your goals, no matter what needs to be sacrificed. You're gonna make a great doctor one day, and I might just go see you for medical care to see whether HMS trained someone properly xD. Until then, you're gonna continue to prove to us why you're going to be amazing one day with the hard work you put in. I can't wait to see where you end up one day. Sending a BIG HUG your way!<br><br>

Con amor,<br>
Esteban
