      Hey Stephany,<br><br>

Iâ€™ve enjoyed getting to know you over the course of our 3/4 of a year at Harvard together. I admire your strength and your will to do your best.  It was great being at your baptism and I enjoyed hearing your beautiful voice at DOXA. As you step into another year of your life, I hope you continue to make people laugh with your sense of humor and sarcasm and I hope that you continue to grow as a person and more importantly as a child of God. Hopefully we can see each other in person soon!

<br><br>Love,<br>

Bernadette Looney
