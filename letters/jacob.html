      My beloved Stephany,<br>
How could we forget how we originally met? #CSIF (If you can’t figure out that
hashtag, shame on you) You are amazing. Thank goodness we didn’t let the initial
awkwardness get to us. You’ve been an amazing friend to me. Always there if I needed
you. Plus, you’re so fun to be around. Remember that night at SAE? Good times.
Downing shots and Claws in B-41, going to the Quad to party, sitting at Cabot studying,
chillin in the Straus Common Room and talking, ice skating in Boston Common—I miss
it all. Most of all, I miss you. I can’t wait until the day I can see you in person and hug
you tight.<br>
Happy freakin birthday I love you so much<br>
Jacob J
