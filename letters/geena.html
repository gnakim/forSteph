      To my favorite church-going, pubG-playing, love-island-watching, tiktoker roommate:
      <br><br>Hey!
      Happy happy happy birthday!<br>

      You've become such an important person to me in such a short amount of time. Haha I remember the first time we met in B-41 and ur heels were bleeding. Gosh, what an intro. Little did I know!
      <br> In the half-ish year that I’ve known you, you’ve taught me so much –patience, grace, kindness, dedication, the insurmountable importance of a good sleep schedule, etc.
You’re really such a ray of SUNSHINE. Good on you.<br>
      Not only are you kind, but you’re also super strong, and very few people can be both those things at the same time. Super admire that about you. You’re gonna be a GREAT doctor. I mean it!<br>
      Ur a dope roommate and i’m really glad ur in my life!<br>
      Thanks for being the best!<br>
      I hope you have the bestest birthday in quarantine<br>

      Loveyahun <3

      <br><br>AGGRESSIVELY WARM REGARDS,
      <br>geena
