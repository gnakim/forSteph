      To my favorite church-going, pubG-playing, love-island-watching, tiktoker roommate:
      <br><br>Hey!
      Happy happy happy birthday!<br>
      You've become such an important person to me in such a short amount of time. I really think it's because of your character. You have a really good nature.<br>
      Not only are you strong, but you’re also super kind, and very few people can be both those things at the same time. Super admire that about you.<br>
      Ur a dope roommate and i’m really glad ur in my life!<br>
      Thanks for being the best!<br>
      I hope you have the bestest birthday in quarantine<br>

      Loveyahun <3

      <br><br>AGGRESSIVELY WARM REGARDS,
      <br>geena
