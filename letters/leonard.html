      HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEPH 💛💛💛 <br>

It seems like an eternity ago that I met you pre-FOP (when I thought Joey was your boyfriend LMAO) and had that deep-ass conversation on the bus, but look at us now ~ we’re old sophomores what the heck??<br>

Honestly, never a dull moment around you. Thanks for all your wacky memories and shenanigans - from Christmas movies in B41, to late late nights at Tasty, to crashing in my dorm (F), to all the fucking bananas you took from the Berg, to ~ Justin ~, to bothering me while I’m trying to PSET lol, to making fun of my singing, you’ve made my college experience unforgettable in the best way possible.<br>

But I’m even more grateful for your endless support for your friends and positivity - no matter how shitty life can be, you’re always smiling, have your chin up, and are there for all of us. Through your resilience, day in and day out, you inspire me to become a better person😊<br>

Anyways, before this gets to sappy, I hope you have a GREAT rest of the day and find ~ something ~ exciting to do, and again HAPPY BIRTHDAY‼️🎂‼️🎂‼️🎂<br>
