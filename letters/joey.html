      Dear Stephany,<br>

Happy Birthday!! I can't express how happy I am that we have become so close over the past year! Our middle school selves on the bus could never have imagined it! You are such a genuine, caring person, and you have so much love to give to the world. You are also incredibly talented, and I know that one day I'll be bragging about how I know you. I always have so much fun when I am with you no matter what we are doing, whether it's failing tennis tryouts together, making fun of Rebecca and Dr. Czeisler, going to parties, or just laying around your room laughing at the stupidest stuff in the world. You really did make my freshman year at Harvard a hundred times better than it would have been otherwise, and I'm so, SO excited to spend the next three years with you! <br>

I hope you have a fantastic day today because you really deserve it! Thank you for being such an amazing person and friend<br>

So much love,<br>
Joey
