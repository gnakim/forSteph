    <h1>Sarida Morejon </h1>
    <p>
      geena got really <br>
mad at me because this<br>
letter<br>
was so<br>
late but i couldn’t bring myself to start writing<br>
words on a page because nothing felt <br>
good enough, <br>
sufficiently genuine or<br>
true to how much i<br>
love you.<br>
<br>
it’s a different kind of love you and <br>
i talk about love all the time and how much we <br>
love it. are intoxicated by boys and kissing and <br>
alcohol and i question all of these loves but never<br>
ours<br>
<br>
because it’s a different kind of love we met in a <br>
different kind of way: in the<br>
woods away from the<br>
noise of fake friendships and distractions <br>
we had no choice but to share our life stories, and i figured i’d rather share mine with<br>
you than with the wind so i<br>
<br>
haven’t looked back since we were among the<br>
trees<br>
<br>
you have been my best friend and my<br>
worst friend worst when you<br>
care about me too much when you<br>
tell me i’m wrong, or paranoid, or<br>
right.<br>
<br>
because you are usually right, calm, and or wrong in those moments<br>
respectively <br>

i am so grateful for those moments<br>
i am so thankful i get to call you my friend and<br>
as we both know<br>
im not religious<br>
but i do consider you a <br>
blessing<br>
    </p>
